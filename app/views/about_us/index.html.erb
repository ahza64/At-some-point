      <p class="bio">(Said in one breath) John “Face Like a Sunset” Ruhsam has been described as 60% Battle Cat, 30% protein powder, and 20% pure excellence. That’s 10% extra of a 178 lbs hunk o’ man because we don’t half ass anything here at @SomePoint. This project peaked John’s interest when he realized he could go to the gym, the laundromat (because he’s not stanky people) back to the gym, then to his waxing appointment efficiently and optimized as F*Bomb. This Buffalo blanketless sweet piece of meat is as handsome as he is productive in a TDD environment ripe with Rspec loving. #concatenation</p>

      <p class="bio">CSS, stands for Cleary's Superior Styling. There is no Margin for error here, so give me some Padding. When you're on the Top you can see all the way to the Border but you can't realy see the Height. It is a Relative Position. It almost feels like your Floating, it's quite a Display. Don't go too far though, you might Overflow. Thats about all that needed to be Covered. I'm out! #z-index.</p>

      <p class="bio">Jonny Rails is a pirate Blustering in from sea, With a rollicking song, he sweeps along, Swaggering boisterously. His branch has merge conflicts. He wears a hooded sash, With a warriors hat about his head, And a bristling black mustache. He growls as he storms the commons, A villain big with code. Jonny Rails Pillages just for fun. Useing Rails or Node.

      <p class="bio">Who, what, where, when, why, how. It’s kind of what I’m about. If we need a controller, I’m there. If we need to change databases, I’m on it. Heroku givin’ you problems? I’ve got the Chuck Norris beard punch that traverses the ether and the time space continuum. When things get sideways, I’ve got the level. Wether it’s getting data in or data coming out, I’ll concatenate your strings, parse out your ids and dot method your JSON to death. My entrancing gaze puts your pin on the map, with or without your google maps API key. </p>

    <p class="aboutApp">You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. Now, I don't know exactly when we turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived the slide... and only five made it out. Now we took an oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man. </p>
